# SIMPLE SHELL

- The ***shell*** is your interface to the operating system. It acts as a
***command interpreter***; takes each command and passes it to the operating
system. It then displays the results of this operation on your screen.

- `the shell` works like the bash and other basic shells.

- The Shell works by being compiled using GCC 4.8.4 compiler or later versions.
The shell can compile using `gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`.
